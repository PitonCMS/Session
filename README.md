#PHP Session Handler

This class maintains user session state across page views. A hashed, salted session key is set in a cookie which is the key to the session record in a MySQL table. The session key is a salted encyrpted hash. The session key is regenerated every 5 minutes, or as set in the configuation file. No information, other than the key, is stored client side. All user session information is kept server side in a database table. 

When the session runs the session handler looks for a session record matching the cookie key, and if found it then runs optional checks to validate the session. If any of the checks fail, or if the session has timed out, the session is destoyed and a new session is started.

Session data can be set and retrieved at any time as either a key (string) value pair, or an array of key-value pairs.

## Installation
You can use Composer to install the session handler or just download the files to your project.

### Using Composer
Modify your `composer.json` project file to require this package.

```json
"require": {
  "wolfmoritz/session": "~1.0.0"
}
```

Then run `composer install`. This will download the files and register the class with the composer autoloader.
 
### Or Just the Files, Please
If you do not use Composer, download this project and unzip. The only file you need is `src/Session/SessionHandler.php`. Place that file in your project and be sure to include it in your startup script.

### Create the Table
You will need to create the session table in your MySQL database using the **SessionTable.sql** script. You can change the table name in the script if desired, but you will need to provide the table name as a configuration item for `tableName`.

## Usage
To use the session handler create a new instance of `SessionHandler` passing in a PDO database connection and the configuration array. 

### Provide a PDO Connection
Define a new PDO connection and pass it in as the first argument of the constructor.

```php
$dsn = 'mysql:host=' . HOST . ';dbname=' . DBNAME;
$dbh = new PDO($dsn, USERNAME, PASSWORD, DB_OPTIONS);
```

### Define Configuruation
Define a configuration array and only include the options you wish to change. The only required configuration option is your application's encryption key. Use a long, random string and do not share it.

**Options**

Option|Default|Description
---|:---:|---
cookieName | 'sessionCookie' | Your session cookie name.
tableName|'session'|Name of the MySQL table that stores your sessions.
secondsUntilExpiration|7200|How long before the session expires in seconds.
renewalTime|300|How long before the session key is regenerated in seconds.
expireOnClose|false|Whether or not to destroy the session when the browser closes, true or false.
checkIpAddress|false|Whether or not to match the IP address to the stored session, true or false.
checkUserAgent|false|Whether or not to match the User Agent to the stored session, true or false.
secureCookie|false|Whether or not to set an encrypted cookie, true of false. Note, this only works when using *https*.
salt|*none*|Your custom encryption key. Any long (16+ characters) string of characters.

```php
$config['salt'] = 'akjfao8ygoa8hba9707lakusdof87';
$config['secondsUntilExpiration'] = 1800; // 30 minutes
// More configuration options ...
```

### Creating a Session
Create a new session as part of your application flow.

```php
$Session = new WolfMoritz\SessionHandler($dbh, $config);
```

The session runs immediately and checks for a valid session, regenerates the session key if necessary, and loads any existing session data for immediate retrieval. Create the session object once, or simply add it to your Dependency Injection Container as a singleton.

### Save Session Data
Once the session is running, you can add or update session data by passing in key-value pairs or an array of key-value pairs using the `setData()` method. The value can be any type as long as it is serializable.

```php
// Save simple key-value pair
$Session->setData('someKey', 'someValue');

// Save array of key-value pairs
$sessionData = array(
  'feline' => 'cat',
  'canine' => 'dog',
  'lastModified' => 1422592486
);
$Session->setData($sessionData);
```

Supplying the same key will overwrite any prior value saved in session.

### Get Session Data
To get session data pass in the item key to `getData()`. The method returns `null` if no key was found. To get all session data simply do not provide an argument.

```php
// Get one session item
$value = $Session->getData('someKey');

// Get all session items
$values = $Session->getData();
```

### Unset Session Data
You can delete a session item by passing in the item key to `unsetData()`, or delete all session data by not providing an argument.

```php
// Delete one session item
$Session->unsetData('someKey');

// Delete all session data
$Session->unsetData();
```

### Delete a Session
Any session that does not pass validation will be destoyed automatically. But, if you want to delete a session call the `destroy()` method.

```php
$Session->destroy();
```

# WARNING
Use this session class at your own risk. Read the code, and understand what it does if you intend on using this for authentication. I make no warranty if something goes wonky.
